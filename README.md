# dmsformat

This is a small library which lets you convert from decimal lon/lat coordinates to dms (date-minute-second) format and back. It is mainly an attempt to merge the functionality of [formatcoords](https://github.com/nerik/formatcoords) and [parse-dms](https://github.com/gmaclennan/parse-dms) behind a single API.
